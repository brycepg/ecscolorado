	<p>Emergency Computer Service is an onsite and in-house tech support company, in business in Colorado Springs since 1995. We support computers running Microsoft operating systems, from Windows 95 through Windows 7, and all flavors in between. We also support Apple computers and their operating systems. </p>

	<p>Our employees have been in the tech support business since 1985.</p>

	<p>We offer onsite computer service at the following rates: $40 driveout fee for Colorado Springs and the surrounding area. Once onsite, we charge $60 per hour with a minimum of 1/2 hour. </p>

	<p>Clients may also bring the machine in and avoid paying a driveout fee. In-house, we charge a flat rate of $60 for virus removal, and $60 hourly for other tasks.</p>

	<p>Clients may also buy service contracts in 10-hour increments and use those hours as needed. There is no charge for driveouts for a client under such a contract- a savings of $40 per trip! This works very well for branch offices and for businesses in general.</p>

	<p>In store, we carry a variety of typical computer accessories and components such as power supplies, wireless cards, keyboards, mice, routers and any cable you might need. </p>

	<p>We are also an ebay seller. We charge 20% of the selling cost, to sell your items for you on ebay. Just bring it to us, and we'll do the rest. Any associated listing/selling fees are paid by you. </p>
